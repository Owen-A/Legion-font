A symbol font for the Star Wars Legion Miniatures Game, by Fantasy Flight Games. 

Intended for use in promos, alt art cards and other printed and online material related to Legion. 

Created in Font Forge, based largely on scans and traces of existing cards. 

Please note this is my first font/use of Font Forge so I'm learning as I go.
